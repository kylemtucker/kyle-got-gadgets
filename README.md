## Welcome to Kyle Got Gadgets

This is my personal repository used as a codebase for all my independently developed projects. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me via email at: kyletucker at berkeley dot edu

### 3D Lidar

This is a project developed by myself that leverages a cheap 2d lidar with precise angular and rotational encoding to provide functionality similar to a 3d lidar device. Currently, this has been developed for ROS functionality using LOAM mapping techniques (Laser Odometry And Mapping) for map creation and localization. 
More information about the LOAM ROS packages can be found in my repository labeled "Open Source LOAM"

### GCC_Project

This is a project branched off of the Gamecube Controller Project , which leverages an arduino nano board to manipulate Gamecube controller outputs to level the playing field in the videogame, Super Smash Bros Melee (Gamecube, 2001). I love this game with a burning passion and I would love to chat with you about what I have been developing, as well as get feedback for possible future gamecube controller plugins!

### Vending Machine

This is a project I have been developing independently, which uses an Arduino Uno board to control a basic visual interface, as well as vending operations for a home-made vending machine. This project can verify the validity of transactions using a custom cryptologically secure hash-function that is decoded on a host computer, which monitors mobile payment.

### Cart Turn Signals

Shopping at Whole Foods as an Amazon Prime Now shopper has its own set of challenges. One such challenge revolves around maintaining a proper social distance while navigating store aisles. This cart turn signal gadget is mountable on any cart, and provides a means of communicating your intention of travel with other customers!
